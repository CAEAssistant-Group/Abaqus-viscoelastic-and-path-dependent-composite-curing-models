# Abaqus-viscoelastic-and-path-dependent-composite-curing-models
This project presents two innovative approaches for examining residual stresses in composites: a viscoelastic model and a path-dependent model. The implementation of these models is carried out in Abaqus CAE, utilizing Fortran subroutines such as USDFLD, UMAT, HETVAL, UEXPAN, and DISP.

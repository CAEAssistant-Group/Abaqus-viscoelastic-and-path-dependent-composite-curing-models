# Path-dependent-and-viscoelastic-Abaqus-models-for-the-analysis-of-composite-curing
This project presents two innovative approaches for examining residual stresses in composites, induced by curing: an Abaqus viscoelastic model and a path-dependent Abaqus model. The implementation of these models is carried out in Abaqus CAE, utilizing multiple Fortran subroutines such as USDFLD, UMAT, HETVAL, UEXPAN, and DISP.
